## Disable Quick Prototyping

### Removing the insecure package

- Every newly created Meteor project has the ```insecure package``` installed by default.
- This package allows us to edit the database from the client, which is useful for quick prototyping.
- We need to remove it, because as the name suggests it is ```insecure```.
  ```
  meteor remove insecure
  ```
- Now our app changes donâ€™t work anymore as we have revoked all client-side database permissions. If we try to insert a new contact for example, we are going to see ${{\color{red}insert \ failed: Access \ denied }}$ in our browser console.

### Removing the autopublish package

- Just like with ```insecure package```, all new Meteor apps start with the ```autopublish package```, which automatically synchronizes all the database contents to the client. So we should remove it:
  ```
  meteor remove autopublish
  ```
- When the app refreshes, the contacts list will be empty. Without the ```autopublish package```, we will have to specify explicitly what the server sends to the client.
- The functions in Meteor that do this are ```Meteor.publish``` and ```Meteor.subscribe```.
